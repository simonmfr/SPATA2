\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{spata2} or, in case of S4 generics,
objects of classes for which a method has been defined.}

\item{sc_input}{Data.frame that contains the results from single cell deconvolution.
Must have at least three columns:
\itemize{
\item{\emph{x} : }{ numeric. Position of cell on the x axis in pixel.},
\item{\emph{y} :}{ numeric. Position of cell on the y axis in pixel.},
\item{\emph{cell_type} :}{ factor Cell type of the cell.}
}}

\item{id}{Character value specifying the ID of the spatial annotation of interest.
If there is only one spatial annotation in the object, the function
will default to using it. However, if there are multiple annotations,
this argument must be explicitly specified to identify the target annotation.}

\item{distance}{Distance value. Specifies the distance from the border of the
spatial annotation to the \emph{horizon} in the periphery up to which the screening
is conducted. (See details for more.) - See details of \code{?is_dist} for more
information about distance values. Defaults to a distance that covers the whole
tissue using \code{\link[=distToEdge]{distToEdge()}}.}

\item{binwidth}{Distance value. The width of the distance bins to which
each data point is assigned. Defaults to our platform dependent
recommendation using \code{\link[=recBinwidth]{recBinwidth()}}.}

\item{angle_span}{Numeric vector of length 2. Confines the area screened by
an angle span relative to the center of the spatial annotation.
(See details fore more.)}

\item{normalize}{Logical. If set to TRUE values will be scaled to 0-1.

Hint: Variables that are uniformly expressed can not be scaled and are discarded.}

\item{as_models}{Adjusts the output to a list that is a valid input for
\code{models_add}-argument of \code{spatialAnnotationScreening()}.}
}
\value{
Data.frame as is returned by \code{getSasDf()} with cell types as variables.
