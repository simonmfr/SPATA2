\arguments{
\item{object}{Any object for which a method has been defined.}

\item{...}{Used to absorb deprecated arguments or functions.}

\item{id}{Character value specifying the ID of the spatial annotation of interest.
If there is only one spatial annotation in the object, the function
will default to using it. However, if there are multiple annotations,
this argument must be explicitly specified to identify the target annotation.}

\item{variables}{Character vector. The numeric variables of interest. Must be inside:

\itemize{
\item{ \strong{Gene sets} Must be in \code{getGeneSets()}}
\item{ \strong{Genes} Must be in \code{getGenes()}}
\item{ \strong{Features} Must be in \code{getFeatureNames(..., of_class = "numeric")}}
}}

\item{distance}{Distance value. Specifies the distance from the border of the
spatial annotation to the \emph{horizon} in the periphery up to which the screening
is conducted. (See details for more.) - See details of \code{?is_dist} for more
information about distance values. Defaults to a distance that covers the whole
tissue using \code{\link[=distToEdge]{distToEdge()}}.}

\item{binwidth}{Distance value. The width of the distance bins to which
each data point is assigned. Defaults to our platform dependent
recommendation using \code{\link[=recBinwidth]{recBinwidth()}}.}

\item{angle_span}{Numeric vector of length 2. Confines the area screened by
an angle span relative to the center of the spatial annotation.
(See details fore more.)}

\item{summarize_with}{Character value. Name of the function with which to summarize.}

\item{model_subset}{Character value. Used as a regex to subset models.
Use \code{validModelNames()} to obtain all model names that are known to \code{SPATA2}
and \code{showModels()} to visualize them.}

\item{model_remove}{Character value. Used as a regex to remove models
are not supposed to be included.}

\item{model_add}{Named list. Every slot in the list must be either a formula
containing a function that takes a numeric vector as input and returns a numeric
vector with the same length as its input vector. Or a numeric vector with the
same length as the input vector. Test models with \code{showModels()}.}

\item{switch}{By default, the labels are displayed on the top and
right of the plot. If \code{"x"}, the top labels will be
displayed to the bottom. If \code{"y"}, the right-hand side
labels will be displayed to the left. Can also be set to
\code{"both"}.}

\item{fill}{Character value. The color with which the columns are filled.}
}
\description{
Visualize the evaluation of the fit of a numeric variable
against models around the area of an image annotation.
