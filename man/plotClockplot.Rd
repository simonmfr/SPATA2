\arguments{
\item{object}{Any object for which a method has been defined.}

\item{...}{Used to absorb deprecated arguments or functions.}

\item{variables}{Character vector. The numeric variables of interest. Must be inside:

\itemize{
\item{ \strong{Gene sets} Must be in \code{getGeneSets()}}
\item{ \strong{Genes} Must be in \code{getGenes()}}
\item{ \strong{Features} Must be in \code{getFeatureNames(..., of_class = "numeric")}}
}}

\item{distance}{Distance value. Specifies the distance from the border of the
image annotation to the \emph{horizon} in the periphery up to which the screening
is conducted. (See details for more.) - See details of \code{?is_dist} for more
information about distance values.}

\item{n_bins_circle}{Numeric value or vector of length 2. Specifies how many times the area is buffered with the value
denoted in \code{binwidth}.
(See details for more.)}

\item{binwidth}{Distance value. The width of the circular bins to which
the barcode-spots are assigned. We recommend to set it equal to the center-center
distance: \code{binwidth = getCCD(object)}. (See details for more.) - See details of \code{?is_dist} for more
information about distance values.}

\item{angle_span}{Numeric vector of length 2. Confines the area screened by
an angle span relative to the center of the image annotation.
(See details fore more.)}

\item{summarize_with}{Character value. Either \emph{'mean'} or \emph{'median'}.
Specifies the function with which the bins are summarized.}

\item{model_subset}{Character value. Used as a regex to subset models.
Use \code{validModelNames()} to obtain all model names that are known to \code{SPATA2}
and \code{showModels()} to visualize them.}

\item{model_remove}{Character value. Used as a regex to remove models
are not supposed to be included.}

\item{model_add}{Named list. Every slot in the list must be either a formula
containing a function that takes a numeric vector as input and returns a numeric
vector with the same length as its input vector. Or a numeric vector with the
same length as the input vector. Test models with \code{showModels()}.}

\item{switch}{By default, the labels are displayed on the top and
right of the plot. If \code{"x"}, the top labels will be
displayed to the bottom. If \code{"y"}, the right-hand side
labels will be displayed to the left. Can also be set to
\code{"both"}.}

\item{fill}{Character value. The color with which the columns are filled.}
}
\description{
Visualize the evaluation of the fit of a numeric variable
against models around the area of an image annotation.
