}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{SPATA2}.}

\item{...}{Used to absorb deprecated arguments or functions.}

\item{id}{Character value. Denotes the spatial trajectory
of interest.}

\item{variables}{Character vector. The numeric variables of interest. Must be inside:

\itemize{
\item{ \strong{Gene sets} Must be in \code{getGeneSets()}}
\item{ \strong{Genes} Must be in \code{getGenes()}}
\item{ \strong{Features} Must be in \code{getFeatureNames(..., of_class = "numeric")}}
}}

\item{binwidth}{Distance value. The width of the bins to which
the barcode-spots are assigned. We recommend to set it equal to the center-center
distance: \code{binwidth = ccDist(object)}. (See details for more.) - See details
of \code{?is_dist} for more information about distance values.}

\item{n_bins}{Numeric value. Specifies the exact number of bins the barcodes
are binned into.}

\item{method_gs}{Character value. The method according to which gene sets will
be handled specified as a character of length one. This can be either 'mean
or one of 'gsva', 'ssgsea', 'zscore', or 'plage'. The latter four will be given to gsva::GSVA().}

\item{normalize}{Logical. If set to TRUE values will be scaled to 0-1.

Hint: Variables that are uniformly expressed can not be scaled and are discarded.}

\item{summarize_with}{Character value. Name of the function with which to summarize.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If set to TRUE informative messages regarding
the computational progress will be printed.

(Warning messages will always be printed.)}

\value{
Data.frame. (See details for more.)

\description{
Extracts a data.frame that contains information about barcode-spots
needed for analysis related to \code{spatialTrajectoryScreening()}.
}
\details{
Initially the projection data.frame of the specified trajectory
is joined with the respective input of variables via \code{joinWithVariables()}.

The argument \code{binwidth} refers to the amount of which the barcode-spots of the
given trajectory will be summarized with regards to the trajectory's direction:
The amount of \code{binwidth} and the previously specified 'trajectory width' in \code{createTrajectories()}
determine the length and width of the sub-rectangles in which the rectangle the
trajectory embraces is split and in which all barcode-spots are binned.
Via \code{dplyr::summarize()} the variable-means of every sub-rectangle are calculated.
These mean-values are then arranged along to the trajectory's direction.

Eventually the data.frame is shifted via \code{tidyr::pivot_longer()} to a data.frame in which
every observation refers to the mean-value of one of the specified variable-elements (e.g. a specified
gene set) of the particular sub-rectangle. The returned data.frame contains the following variables:

\itemize{
\item{\emph{trajectory_part}: Character. Specifies the trajectory's sub-part of the observation. (Negligible if there is
only one trajectory part.)}
\item{\emph{trajectory_part_order}: Numeric. Indicates the order within the trajectory-part. (Negligible if there is
only one trajectory part.)}
\item{\emph{trajectory_order}: Numeric. Indicates the order within the whole trajectory.}
\item{\emph{variables}: Character. The respective gene sets, gene or feature the value refers to.}
\item{\emph{values}: Numeric. The summarized values.}}
}
\note{
\code{getTrajectoryScreeningDf()} summarizes by bins by default.
To obtain the coordinates joined with the projection length set \code{summarize_with}
to \code{FALSE} or use \code{getProjectionDf()}. The same applies if you want to join grouping
variables to the data.frame (can not be summarized).
