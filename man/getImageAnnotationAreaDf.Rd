\usage{
getImageAnnotationAreaDf(
  object,
  ids = NULL,
  tags = NULL,
  test = "any",
  add_tags = FALSE,
  sep = " & ",
  last = " & "
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{SPATA2}.}

\item{ids}{Character vector or \code{NULL}. If character, specifies the IDs
of the image annotations of interest. If numeric, the image annotations are picked by number.
If \code{NULL}, all image annotations are included - subsequent selection with \code{tags} and
\code{test} is possible.}

\item{tags, test}{Input for argument \code{tags} specifies the tags of interest.
Argument \code{test} decides about how the specified tags are used to select
the image annotations of interest. There are multiple options:
\enumerate{
\item Argument \code{test} set to \emph{'any'} or \emph{1}: To be included, an image annotation
must be tagged with at least one of the input tags.
\item Argument \code{test} set to \emph{'all'} or \emph{2}: To be included, an image annotation
must be tagged with all of the input tags. Can contain tags that are not specified.
\item Argument \code{test} set to \emph{'identical'} or \emph{3}: To be included, an image annotation
must be tagged with all of the input tags. Can not be tagged with anything else.
\item Argument \code{test} set to \emph{not_identical} or \emph{4}: To be included, an image
annotation must \strong{not} be tagged with the combination of input tags.
\item Argument \code{test} set to \emph{'none'} or \emph{5}: To be included, an image annotation
must \strong{not} contain any of the input tags.
}

Note that the filtering process happens in addition to / after the filtering by input for argument
\code{ids}.}
}
\value{
A data.frame that contains the grouping variables \emph{id} and \emph{tags}
and the numeric variables \emph{x} and \emph{y}. The returned data.frame can contain
the spatial extent of more than just
one annotated structure, depending on the input of arguments \code{ids}, \code{tags}
and \code{test}. The variable \emph{ids} of the returned data.frame is used to
uniquely mark the belonging of each x- and y-coordinate.
}
\description{
Extracts the coordinates of the polygon that was drawn to
annotate structures in the histology image in a data.frame.
}
\note{
The variables \emph{x} and \emph{y} correspond to the coordinates
with which the annotated structure was denoted in \code{annotateImage()}. These
coordinates are not to be confused with coordinates of barcode spots that might
fall in to the area of the polygon! To obtain a data.frame of barcode spots that fall in to
the spatial extent of the annotated structure along with their coordinates
use \code{getImageAnnotationBarcodes()}.
