\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{SPATA2}.}

\item{binwidth}{Numeric value. Denotes the binwidth with which to sort all
relevant barcode spots into groups that are then aligned with respect to the
chosen trajectory's direction.#'}

\item{n_bins}{Numeric value. Specifies the exact number of bins the barcodes
are binned into.}

\item{method_gs}{Character value. The method according to which gene sets will
be handled specified as a character of length one. This can be either 'mean
or one of 'gsva', 'ssgsea', 'zscore', or 'plage'. The latter four will be given to gsva::GSVA().}

\item{smooth_method}{The smoothing method that will be used specified as a
single character value (e.g. \emph{"lm", "glm", "gam", "loess"}).}

\item{smooth_span}{Numeric value. Controls the degree of smoothing.
Given to argument \code{span} of \code{stats::loess()}.}

\item{smooth_se}{Logical. If set to TRUE the confidence interval will be}

\item{clrp}{Character value. Specifies the color palette to be used to represent
groups of discrete variables. Run \code{validColorPalettes()} to obtain valid
input options.}

\item{clrp_adjust}{Named character vector or NULL. If character, it adjusts the
color palette that is used to represent the groups. Names of the input vector must refer
to the group and the respective named element denotes the color with which to
represent the group.}

\item{display_trajectory_parts}{Logical. If set to TRUE the returned plot
visualizes the parts in which the trajectory has been partitioned while beeing
drawn.}

\item{display_facets}{Logical. If set to TRUE sub plots for every specified gene, gene-set
or feature are displayed via \code{ggplot2::facet_wrap()}}

\item{linesize}{Numeric value. Specifies the thicknes of the lines with which
the trajectory dynamics are displayed.}

\item{vlinesize, vlinecolor}{Adjusts size and color of vertical lines that
display the trajectory parts.}

\item{vlinetype}{Adjusts the type of the vertical lines that display the trajectory
parts.}

\item{x_nth}{Numeric value. If the number of breaks/labels on the
x-axis becomes too high \code{x_nth} can be used to reduce it. If \code{x_nth} is 1,
every label is kept. If 2, every second label is kept. If 3, every
third label is kept. And so on.}

\item{summarize_with}{Character value. Name of the function with which to summarize.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If set to TRUE informative messages regarding
the computational progress will be printed.

(Warning messages will always be printed.)}

\item{...}{Additional arguments given to \code{ggplot2::facet_wrap()} if argument
\code{display_facets} is set to TRUE.}
}
\value{
Returns a ggplot-object that can be additionally customized according
to the rules of the ggplot2-framework.
