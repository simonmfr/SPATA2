\description{
Plots expression changes against the distance to
a spatial annotation using lineplots.

\details{
In conjunction with argument \code{id} which provides the
ID of the spatial annotation of interest the arguments \code{distance},
\code{binwidth}, \code{n_bins_dist}, \code{angle_span} and \code{n_bins_angle} can be used
to specify the exact area that is screened as well as the resolution of the screening.

\bold{How the algorithm works:} During the SAS-algorithm the data points are
binned according to their localisation to the spatial annotation. Every bin's mean
expression of a given gene is then aligned in an ascending order - mean expression
of bin 1, mean expression of bin 2, ... up to the last bin, the bin with the
data points that lie farest away from the spatial annotation. This allows to infer
the gene expression changes in relation to the spatial annotation and
to screen for genes whose expression changes resemble specific biological
behaviors. E.g. linear ascending: gene expression increases linearly with
the distance to the spatial annotation. E.g. immediate descending: gene expression
is high in close proximity to the spatial annotation and declines logarithmically
with the distance to the spatial annotation.

\bold{How distance binning works:}
To bin data points according to their localisation to the spatial annotation
two of the following three parameters are required (the third one is calculated):

\itemize{
\item{\code{distance}: The distance from the border of the spatial annotation to
the \emph{horizon} in the periphery up to which the screening is conducted.
}
\item{\code{binwidth}: The width of every bin.}
\item{\code{n_bins_dist}: The number of bins that are created.}
}

These three parameters stand in the following relation to each other:

\enumerate{
\item{\code{n_bins_dist} = \code{distance} / \code{binwidth}}
\item{\code{distance} = \code{n_bins_dist} * \code{binwidth}}
\item{\code{binwidth} = \code{distance} / \code{n_bins_dist}}
}

Once the parameters are set and calculated the polygon that is used to
define the borders of the spatial annotation is repeatedly expanded by the distance
indicated by parameter \code{binwidth}. The number of times this expansion is
repeated is equal to the parameter \code{n_bins_dist}. Every time the
polygon is expanded, the newly enclosed data points are binned (grouped)
and the bin is given a number that is equal to the number of the expansion.
Thus, data points that are adjacent to the spatial annotation are binned into
bin 1, data points that lie a distance of \code{binwidth} away are binned into
bin 2, etc.

Note that \code{\link[=plotSurfaceSAS]{plotSurfaceSAS()}} and/or \code{\link[=ggpLayerExpansionsSAS]{ggpLayerExpansionsSAS()}} allow to
visually inspect if your input results in the desired screening.

\bold{How the screening works:} For every numeric variable (e.g. genes) that
is included in the screening process every bin's mean expression is calculated
and then aligned in an ascending order - mean expression of distance bin 1,
mean expression of distance bin 2, ... up to the last bin, namely the bin
with the data points that lie farest away from the spatial annotation. This
allows to infer the gene expression changes in relation to the spatial annotation and
to screen for genes whose expression changes resemble specific biological
behaviors. The gene expression change is fitted to every model that is included.
(Use \code{showModels()} to visualize the predefined models of \code{SPATA2}).
A gene-model-fit is evaluated twofold:

\itemize{
\item{Mean Absolute Error}: Add description.
\item{Root Mean Squared Error}: Add description.
\item{Pearson correlation}: The inferred expression changes is correlated
with the model. (Correlation as well as the corresponding p-value depend
on the number of bins!)
}

\section{Distance measures}{


Several functions in \code{SPATA2} have arguments that take \emph{distance input}.
To specifically refer to a distance the unit must be specified. There are
three ways to create valid input for these arguments.

\strong{1. In pixel:}

There are two valid input options to specify the distance in pixel:

\itemize{
\item{numeric:}{ Single numeric values, e.g. \code{arg_input = c(2, 3.554, 69, 100.67)}. If no unit
is specified the input will be interpreted as pixels.}
\item{character:}{ Suffixed with \emph{'px'}, e.g. \code{arg_input = c('2px', '3.554px', '69px', '100.67px')}}
}

Note: The unit pixel (px) is used for distances as well as for areas. If pixel
refers to a distance the pixel side length is meant. If pixel refers to an area the
number of pixels is meant.

\strong{2. According to the Systeme international d`unites (SI):}

Specifying distances in SI units e.g. \code{arg_input = c('2mm', '4mm')} etc.
requires the input to be a character as the unit must be provided as suffix.
Between the numeric value and the unit must be no empty space! Valid suffixes
can be obtained using the function \code{validUnitsOfLengthSI()}.

\strong{3. As vectors of class \code{unit}:}

Behind the scenes \code{SPATA2} works with the \code{units} package. Input
is converted into vectors of class \code{units}. Therefore, input can be directly
provided this way: \code{arg_input = units::set_unit(x = c(2,4), value = 'mm')}
Note that \emph{pixel} is not a valid unit in the \code{units} package. If you want
to specify the input in pixel you have to use input option 1. In pixel.
