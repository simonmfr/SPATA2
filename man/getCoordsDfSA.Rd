\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{spata2} or, in case of S4 generics,
objects of classes for which a method has been defined.}

\item{id}{Character value specifying the ID of the spatial annotation of interest.
If there is only one spatial annotation in the object, the function
will default to using it. However, if there are multiple annotations,
this argument must be explicitly specified to identify the target annotation.}

\item{distance}{Distance value. Specifies the distance from the border of the
spatial annotation to the \emph{horizon} in the periphery up to which the screening
is conducted. (See details for more.) - See details of \code{?is_dist} for more
information about distance values. Defaults to a distance that covers the whole
tissue using \code{\link[=distToEdge]{distToEdge()}}.}

\item{binwidth}{Distance value. The width of the distance bins to which
each data point is assigned. Defaults to our platform dependent
recommendation using \code{\link[=recBinwidth]{recBinwidth()}}.}

\item{angle_span}{Numeric vector of length 2. Confines the area screened by
an angle span relative to the center of the spatial annotation.
(See details fore more.)}

\item{dist_unit}{Character value. Unit in which the distance is computed.
Defaults to \emph{pixel}.}

\item{coords_df}{Data.frame. If \code{NULL}, the default, the coordinates data.frame obtained
via \code{getCoordsDf()} is used. Else other data.frame of observations can be put in
relation to the spatial annotation. Requires numeric variables named \emph{x} and \emph{y} in
pixel units.}

\item{variables}{Character vector. All numeric variables (meaning genes,
gene-sets and numeric features) that are supposed to be included in
the screening process.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If set to TRUE informative messages regarding
the computational progress will be printed.

(Warning messages will always be printed.)}

\item{...}{Additional arguments given to \code{\link[=joinWithVariables]{joinWithVariables()}}. Only used
if not empty and \code{coords_df} is \code{NULL}.}

\item{n_bins}{Numeric value. Specifies the exact number of bins the barcodes
are binned into.}
}
\value{
Data.frame.
}
\description{
Adds the spatial relation to a spatial
annotation to the coordinates data.frame. See details for more.
}
\details{
The coordinates data.frame as returned by \code{\link[=getCoordsDf]{getCoordsDf()}} with five
additional variables:

\itemize{
\item{\emph{dist}:}{ Numeric. The distance of the data point to the outline of the spatial annotation.}
\item{\emph{dist_unit}:}{ Character. The unit in which the distance is computed.}
\item{\emph{bins_dist}:}{ Factor. The bin the data point was assigned to based on its \emph{dist} value and the \code{binwidth}.}
\item{\emph{angle}:}{ Numeric. The angle of the data point to the center of the spatial annotation.}
\item{\emph{bins_angle}:}{ Factor. The bin the data point was assigned to based on its \emph{angle} value.}
\item{\emph{rel_loc}:}{ Character. Possible values are \emph{'core'}, if the data point lies inside the spatial annotation,
\emph{'periphery'} if the data point lies outside of the boundaries of the spatial annotation but inside
the area denoted via \code{distance} and \emph{outside}, if the data point lies beyond the screening area (it's
distance to the spatial annotation boundaries is bigger than the value denoted in \code{distance}).}
