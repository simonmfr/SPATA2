\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{spata2} or, in case of S4 generics,
objects of classes for which a method has been defined.}

\item{...}{Used to absorb deprecated arguments or functions.}

\item{color_by}{The variable to be displayed by color:

\itemize{
\item{ \strong{Gene set} as a single character value. Must be in \code{getGeneSets()}}
\item{ \strong{Genes} as a character vector. If more than one gene is specified the average
expression of those genes will be calculated and displayed. Must be in \code{getGenes()}}
\item{ \strong{Feature} as a single character value. Must be in \code{getFeaturenNames()}}
}}

\item{method_gs}{Character value. The method according to which gene sets will
be handled specified as a character of length one. This can be either 'mean
or one of 'gsva', 'ssgsea', 'zscore', or 'plage'. The latter four will be given to gsva::GSVA().}

\item{smooth}{Logical. If TRUE, a loess fit is used to smooth the values.}

\item{smooth_span}{Numeric value. Controls the degree of smoothing.
Given to argument \code{span} of \code{stats::loess()}.}

\item{pt_alpha}{Numeric value. Specifies the degree of transparency of all points.}

\item{pt_clr}{Character value. Specifies the color of all points.}

\item{pt_clrp}{The color palette to be used if the specified variable displayed by
color is categorical/discrete. Run \code{validColorPalettes()} to see valid input.}

\item{pt_clrsp}{The color spectrum to be used if the specified variable displayed by
color is continuous. Run \code{validColorSpectra()} to see valid input.}

\item{pt_size}{Numeric value. Specifies the size of all points.}

\item{outline}{Logical, indicating whether to add an outline to the points.
If \code{TRUE}, an outline will be added around the points to enhance visibility.
Default is FALSE.}

\item{clrp_adjust}{Named character vector or NULL. If character, it adjusts the
color palette that is used to represent the groups. Names of the input vector must refer
to the group and the respective named element denotes the color with which to
represent the group.}

\item{display_image}{Logical. If set to TRUE the histology image of the specified sample
is displayed underneath the plot.}

\item{transform_with}{List or \code{NULL.} If list, can be used to transform continuous variables before usage.
Names of the list slots refer to the variable. The content of the slot refers to the transforming functions.
E.g if the variable of interest is \emph{GFAP} gene expression, the following would work:

\itemize{
\item{Single function:}{ \code{transform_with = list(GFAP = log10)}},
\item{Multiple functions:}{ \verb{transform_with = list(GFAP = list(log10, log2)}}
}

In case of plotting:
Useful if you want to apply more than one transformation on variables mapped to
plotting aesthetics. Input for \code{transform_with} is applied before the
respective \code{<aes>_trans} argument.}

\item{use_scattermore}{Logical value. If \code{TRUE}, data points are plotted with
\code{scattermore::geom_scattermore()} which allows quick plotting of several
thousand data points. If the number of data points plotted is bigger than
10.000 it is used anyway.}

\item{bcs_rm}{Character vector or \code{NULL}. If character, specifies the observations
to be removed prior to analysis or visualization by their barcode.}

\item{xrange, yrange}{Vector of length two or \code{NULL}. If not \code{NULL},
specifies the x- and y-range to which the output image is cropped. E.g.
\code{xrange = c(200, 500)} results in the image being cropped from
x-coordinate 200px up to x-coordinate 500px. If \code{NULL}, the original image
ranges are taken.

This argument works within the \code{SPATA2} distance framework.
If values are specified in European units of length the input is
immediately converted to pixel units. See info section \emph{Distance measures}
for more information.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If set to TRUE informative messages regarding
the computational progress will be printed.

(Warning messages will always be printed.)}

\item{image}{An image of class \emph{Image} to be displayed in the background.
Easily accessible via \code{SPATA::image()}.}

\item{sctm_interpolate, sctm_pixels}{Given to the corresponding arguments
of \code{scattermore::geom_scattermore()}. Note: With increasing \code{sctm_pixels}
the point size must be adjusted with the argument \code{pt_size}.}

\item{order_by}{Character value or \code{NULL}. If character, the specified
variable is used to order the data points.}

\item{order_desc}{Logical value. If \code{TRUE}, reverses the arrangement specified
via \code{order_by} and/or \code{order}.}

\item{clr_core, clr_control}{Colors with which to display data points that
are part of the \emph{core} group (inside the spatial annotation) and the \emph{control}
group (neither inside the annotation nor inside the distance intervals)}

\item{outline_width}{Numeric vector of length 2, specifying the factor with which
the \code{pt_size} is multiplied to create the white layer (first value) and the
black layer (second value).}

\item{complete}{Logical. If the provided \code{SPATA2} object has been subsetted by
\code{subsetBySegment()} the original sample is completed with grey barcode
spots.}

\description{
Displays the spatial dimension of the sample and colors the
surface according to the expression of genes, gene sets or features. There
are methods for multiple classes:

\itemize{
\item{\code{spata2}:}{ The most versatile method with which all sorts of spatial
data can be visualized.}
\item{\code{data.frame}:}{ Method for a data.frame that contains at least the
variables \emph{x} and \emph{y}.}
\item{\code{SDEGS}:}{ Method to visualize the surface based on the set up with
which \code{\link[=findSDEGS]{findSDEGS()}} was run.}
\item{\code{\link{SpatialAnnotationScreening}}:}{ Method to visualize the surface based
on the setup with which \code{\link[=spatialAnnotationScreening]{spatialAnnotationScreening()}} was run.}
\item{\code{\link{SpatialTrajectoryScreening}}:}{ Method to visualize the surface based
on the setup with which \code{\link[=spatialAnnotationScreening]{spatialAnnotationScreening()}} was run.}
