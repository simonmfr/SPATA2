\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{spata2} or, in case of S4 generics,
objects of classes for which a method has been defined.}

\item{slot}{The slot of the output assay in the \code{Seurat} object from where to
take the matrix. Defaults to \emph{data}.}

\item{name}{The name under which to store the matrix.}

\item{exchange_counts}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the counts matrix of the \code{spata2}
object is exchanged for the counts matrix in the output assay.}

}
\value{
The input \code{spata2} object containing the added or computed
results.
