\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{spata2} or, in case of S4 generics,
objects of classes for which a method has been defined.}

\item{variables}{Character vector. All numeric variables (meaning genes,
gene-sets and numeric features) that are supposed to be included in
the screening process.}

\item{id}{Character value specifying the ID of the spatial annotation of interest.
If there is only one spatial annotation in the object, the function
will default to using it. However, if there are multiple annotations,
this argument must be explicitly specified to identify the target annotation.}

\item{distance}{Distance value. Specifies the distance from the border of the
spatial annotation to the \emph{horizon} in the periphery up to which the screening
is conducted. (See details for more.) - See details of \code{?is_dist} for more
information about distance values. Defaults to a distance that covers the whole
tissue using \code{\link[=distToEdge]{distToEdge()}}.}

\item{binwidth}{Distance value. The width of the distance bins to which
each data point is assigned. Defaults to our platform dependent
recommendation using \code{\link[=recBinwidth]{recBinwidth()}}.}

\item{angle_span}{Numeric vector of length 2. Confines the area screened by
an angle span relative to the center of the spatial annotation.
(See details fore more.)}

\item{smooth_span}{Numeric value. Controls the degree of smoothing.
Given to argument \code{span} of \code{stats::loess()}.}

\item{unit}{Character value. Specifies the desired unit.}

\item{clrp}{Character value. Specifies the color palette to be used to represent
groups of discrete variables. Run \code{validColorPalettes()} to obtain valid
input options.}

\item{clrp_adjust}{Named character vector or NULL. If character, it adjusts the
color palette that is used to represent the groups. Names of the input vector must refer
to the group and the respective named element denotes the color with which to
represent the group.}

\item{line_color}{Character. Affects color of the main lines of the plot.}

\item{line_size}{Numeric value. Specifies the thicknes of the lines with which
the trajectory dynamics are displayed.}

\item{border_linealpha, border_linecolor, border_linesize, border_linetype}{Given
to \code{ggplot2::geom_vline()}. Adjusts appearance of the vertical line that
represents the border of the spatial annotation.}

\item{ggpLayers}{List of \code{ggproto}-objects that are added to each plot.
Skim \code{ggpLayer*()}-functions for more options.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If set to TRUE informative messages regarding
the computational progress will be printed.

(Warning messages will always be printed.)}

\item{...}{Needed arguments that depend on the input/unit combination. If
one of both is \emph{'px'}, argument \code{object} must be specified.}

\item{sc_input}{Data.frame that contains the results from single cell deconvolution.
Must have at least three columns:
\itemize{
\item{\emph{x} : }{ numeric. Position of cell on the x axis in pixel.},
\item{\emph{y} :}{ numeric. Position of cell on the y axis in pixel.},
\item{\emph{cell_type} :}{ factor Cell type of the cell.}
}}

\item{round}{Numeric value or \code{FALSE}. If numeric, given to \code{digits}
of \code{base::round()}. Rounds transformed values before they are returned.}

\item{scale}{Logical value. If \code{TRUE}, density of cell types is scaled
to make them comparable. Else, the absolute values defined by count/\code{unit}^2
is plotted.}

\item{display_border}{Logical value. If \code{TRUE}, displays a vertical line
to highlight where the border of the spatial annotation runs.}

\item{x_nth}{Numeric value. If the number of breaks/labels on the
x-axis becomes too high \code{x_nth} can be used to reduce it. If \code{x_nth} is 1,
every label is kept. If 2, every second label is kept. If 3, every
third label is kept. And so on.}

\item{nrow, ncol}{Numeric values or NULL. Used to arrange multiple plots.}
}
\value{
A ggplot.
}
\description{
Plots gene expression changes against the distance to
to the spatial annotation using the desing of ridgeplots.

\section{Distance measures}{


Several functions in \code{SPATA2} have arguments that take \emph{distance input}.
To specifically refer to a distance the unit must be specified. There are
three ways to create valid input for these arguments.

\strong{1. In pixel:}

There are two valid input options to specify the distance in pixel:

\itemize{
\item{numeric:}{ Single numeric values, e.g. \code{arg_input = c(2, 3.554, 69, 100.67)}. If no unit
is specified the input will be interpreted as pixels.}
\item{character:}{ Suffixed with \emph{'px'}, e.g. \code{arg_input = c('2px', '3.554px', '69px', '100.67px')}}
}

Note: The unit pixel (px) is used for distances as well as for areas. If pixel
refers to a distance the pixel side length is meant. If pixel refers to an area the
number of pixels is meant.

\strong{2. According to the Systeme international d`unites (SI):}

Specifying distances in SI units e.g. \code{arg_input = c('2mm', '4mm')} etc.
requires the input to be a character as the unit must be provided as suffix.
Between the numeric value and the unit must be no empty space! Valid suffixes
can be obtained using the function \code{validUnitsOfLengthSI()}.

\strong{3. As vectors of class \code{unit}:}

Behind the scenes \code{SPATA2} works with the \code{units} package. Input
is converted into vectors of class \code{units}. Therefore, input can be directly
provided this way: \code{arg_input = units::set_unit(x = c(2,4), value = 'mm')}
Note that \emph{pixel} is not a valid unit in the \code{units} package. If you want
to specify the input in pixel you have to use input option 1. In pixel.
