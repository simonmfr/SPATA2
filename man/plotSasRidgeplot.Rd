\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{\link{SPATA2}} or, in case of S4 generics,
objects of classes for which a method has been defined.}

\item{variables}{Character vector. The numeric variables to be included in
the screening process. Makre sure that the correct matrix is active in the
respective assays.}

\item{ids}{Character vector. Specifies the IDs of the spatial annotations of interest.}

\item{distance}{\code{\link[=concept_distance_measure]{Distance measure}}. Specifies
the distance from the border of the spatial annotation to the \emph{horizon} in
the periphery up to which the screening is conducted. Defaults to a distance
that covers the whole tissue section the spatial annotation is located
on using \code{\link[=distToEdge]{distToEdge()}}. (This distance must not be exceeded.)}

\item{resolution}{\link[=concept_distance_measure]{Distance measure}. The resolution
with which the expression gradient is inferred. Defaults are platform specific.
See more in detail section of \code{\link[=recSgsRes]{recSgsRes()}}.}

\item{angle_span}{Numeric vector of length 2. Confines the area screened by
an angle span relative to the center of its closest spatial annotation.}

\item{smooth_span}{Numeric value. Controls the degree of smoothing.
Given to argument \code{span} of \code{stats::loess()}.}

\item{unit}{Character value. Specifies the desired unit.}

\item{bcs_exclude}{Character value containing the barcodes of observations to be excluded
from the analysis.}

\item{clrp}{Character value. Specifies the color palette to be used to represent
groups of discrete variables. Run \code{validColorPalettes()} to obtain valid
input options.}

\item{clrp_adjust}{Named character vector or NULL. If character, it adjusts the
color palette that is used to represent the groups. Names of the input vector must refer
to the group and the respective named element denotes the color with which to
represent the group.}

\item{line_color}{Character. Affects color of the main lines of the plot.}

\item{line_size}{Numeric. Affects size of the main lines of the plot.}

\item{border_linealpha, border_linecolor, border_linesize, border_linetype}{Given
to \code{ggplot2::geom_vline()}. Adjusts appearance of the vertical line that
represents the border of the spatial annotation.}

\item{ggpLayers}{List of \code{ggproto}-objects that are added to each plot.
Skim \code{ggpLayer*()}-functions for more options.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, informative messages regarding
the computational progress will be printed.

(Warning messages will always be printed.)}

\item{...}{Needed arguments that depend on the input/unit combination. If
one of both is \emph{'px'}, argument \code{object} must be specified.}

\item{scale}{Logical value. If \code{TRUE}, density of cell types is scaled
to make them comparable. Else, the absolute values defined by count/\code{unit}^2
is plotted.}

\value{
A ggplot.
