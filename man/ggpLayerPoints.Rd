\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{spata2} or, in case of S4 generics,
objects of classes for which a method has been defined.}

\item{...}{Used to absorb deprecated arguments or functions.}

\item{pt_alpha}{Numeric value. Specifies the degree of transparency of all points.}

\item{pt_clr}{Character value. Specifies the color of all points.}

\item{pt_size}{Numeric value. Specifies the size of all points.}

\item{clrp}{Character value. Specifies the color palette to be used to represent
groups of discrete variables. Run \code{validColorPalettes()} to obtain valid
input options.}

\item{clrp_adjust}{Named character vector or NULL. If character, it adjusts the
color palette that is used to represent the groups. Names of the input vector must refer
to the group and the respective named element denotes the color with which to
represent the group.}

\item{clrsp}{Character value. Specifies the color spectrum to be used to represent
continuous values of numeric variables. Run \code{validColorSpectra()} to obtain
valid input options.}

\item{smooth}{Logical. If TRUE, a loess fit is used to smooth the values.}

\item{smooth_span}{Numeric value. Controls the degree of smoothing.
Given to argument \code{span} of \code{stats::loess()}.}

\item{normalize}{Logical. If set to TRUE values will be scaled to 0-1.

Hint: Variables that are uniformly expressed can not be scaled and are discarded.}

\item{transform_with}{List or \code{NULL.} If list, can be used to transform continuous variables before usage.
Names of the list slots refer to the variable. The content of the slot refers to the transforming functions.
E.g if the variable of interest is \emph{GFAP} gene expression, the following would work:

\itemize{
\item{Single function:}{ \code{transform_with = list(GFAP = log10)}},
\item{Multiple functions:}{ \verb{transform_with = list(GFAP = list(log10, log2)}}
}

In case of plotting:
Useful if you want to apply more than one transformation on variables mapped to
plotting aesthetics. Input for \code{transform_with} is applied before the
respective \code{<aes>_trans} argument.}

\item{method_gs}{Character value. The method according to which gene sets will
be handled specified as a character of length one. This can be either 'mean
or one of 'gsva', 'ssgsea', 'zscore', or 'plage'. The latter four will be given to gsva::GSVA().}

\item{xrange, yrange}{Vector of length two or \code{NULL}. If not \code{NULL},
specifies the x- and y-range to which the output image is cropped. E.g.
\code{xrange = c(200, 500)} results in the image being cropped from
x-coordinate 200px up to x-coordinate 500px. If \code{NULL}, the original image
ranges are taken.

This argument works within the \code{SPATA2} distance framework.
If values are specified in European units of length the input is
immediately converted to pixel units. See info section \emph{Distance measures}
for more information.}

\item{unit}{The desired unit. Defaults to the unit
in which the original size of the image of the spatial method is
provided. Obtain valid input options with \code{validUnitsOfLengthSI()}.}

\item{breaks}{Specifies where the breaks are set. Labels are plotted in the unit
specified in \code{unit}. Valid input:

\itemize{
\item{\code{NULL}:}{ No specification. Five breaks are set equally distributed. Does not work with STS/IAS related plots as
the range is taken from the whole image.}
\item{\code{vector}:}{ Vector of distance measures. Breaks are set for axes denoted in \code{which}. (Defaults to both, x and y.)}
\item{\code{list}:}{ List with slots \emph{x} and \emph{y}. Vector of distance measures to set each axis specifically.}
}}

\item{expand}{Specifies how the axis are expanded. Using \code{expand} of \code{ggplot2::scale_x/y_continuous()}.
Valid input:

\itemize{
\item{\code{NULL} or \code{TRUE}:}{ No specification. Default is used.}
\item{\code{FALSE}:}{ No expansion.}
\item{\code{vector}:}{ Numeric vector of length two. Input is set for axes denoted in \code{which}. (Defaults to both, x and y.)}
\item{\code{list}:}{ List with slots \emph{x} and \emph{y}. Numeric vector of length two, used for each axis specifically.}
}}

\item{use_scattermore}{Logical value. If \code{TRUE}, data points are plotted with
\code{scattermore::geom_scattermore()} which allows quick plotting of several
thousand data points. If the number of data points plotted is bigger than
10.000 it is used anyway.}

\item{add_labs}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, adds x- and y-labs to the plot.}

\item{bcs_rm}{Character vector or \code{NULL}. If character, specifies the observations
to be removed prior to analysis or visualization by their barcode.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If set to TRUE informative messages regarding
the computational progress will be printed.

(Warning messages will always be printed.)}

\item{img_name}{Character value. The name of the \code{HistoImage} of interest.
If \code{NULL}, the active histo image is chosen by default.}

\item{spot_alpha, spot_size, spot_clr}{Parameters to set the aesthetics
alpha, size, and color of the spots. Arguments \code{alpha_by} and \code{color_by}
are prioritized.}
}
\value{
\code{ggpLayer*()}-functions return lists of \code{ggproto} objects
that can be added to ggplots via the \code{+} operator. In most of the cases
they are supposed to be added to plots created with the \code{plotSurface*()}
family.
}
\description{
Adds the data points (beads, cells, spots, etc.) of the object
to the plot.
